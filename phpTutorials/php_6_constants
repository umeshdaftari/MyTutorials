CONSTANTS
	1. A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
	2. A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).
	3. Note: Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.

CREATING A PHP CONSTANT
	To create a constant, use the define() function.

	Syntax: define(name, value, case-insensitive);
		case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false

	<?php
		define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");
		echo GREETING;
	?>
