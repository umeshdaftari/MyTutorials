PHP supports the following data types:

		String
		Integer
		Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
		Boolean
		Array
		Object
		NULL


STRING
	A string is a sequence of characters, like "Hello world!".
	A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

	<?php 
		$x = "Hello world!";
		$y = 'Hello world!';

		echo $x;
		echo "<br>"; 
		echo $y;
	?>


INTEGER
	1. An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
	2. Rules for integers:

		An integer must have at least one digit
		An integer must not have a decimal point
		An integer can be either positive or negative
		Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)
		In the following example $x is an integer. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

	<?php 
		$x = 5985;
		var_dump($x);
	?>


FLOAT
	1. A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.
	2. In the following example $x is a float. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

	<?php 
		$x = 10.365;
		var_dump($x);
	?>


BOOLEAN
	A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.

	<?php
		$x = true;
		$y = false;
	?>


ARRAY
	1. An array stores multiple values in one single variable.
	2. In the following example $cars is an array. The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

	<?php 
		$cars = array("Volvo","BMW","Toyota");
		var_dump($cars);
	?>


OBJECTS
	1. An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data.
	2. In PHP, an object must be explicitly declared.
	3. First we must declare a class of object. For this, we use the class keyword. A class is a structure that can contain properties and methods:

	<?php
	    class Car {
	        function Car($string) {
	            $this->model = $string;
	        }
	    }
	    
	    // create an object
	    $herbie = new Car("HELLO");
	    
	    // show object properties
	    echo $herbie->model;
	?>


NULL value
	1. Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.
	2. A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.
	3. Tip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.
	4. Variables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:

	<?php
	    $x = "Hello world!";
	    $x = null;
	    var_dump($x);   // NULL
	?>
