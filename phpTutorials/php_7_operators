OPERATORS
	1. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
	2. PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

			Arithmetic operators
			Assignment operators
			Comparison operators
			Increment/Decrement operators
			Logical operators
			String operators
			Array operators

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
	Add: +
	Subtract: -
	Multiply: *
	Divide: /
	Modulus: %
	Power: **    eg., $a ** $b  implies  ($a)^($b)


ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
	=
	+=
	-=
	*=
	/=
	%=


COMPARISON OPERATORS
	Equal: ==
	Identical: ===
	Not equal: !=   or  <>
	Not identical: !==
	Greater than: >
	Greater than equal to: >=
	Lesser than: <
	Lesser than equal to: <=


INCREMENT/DECREMENT OPERATORS
	++
	--


LOGICAL OPERATORS
	and        AND
	or         OR
	xor        EX-OR
	&&         AND
	||		   OR
	!		   NOT


STRING OPERATIONS
	Concatenation:  .
	Concatenation assignment:  .=


ARRAY OPERATORS
	Union:  +
	Equality: ==
	Identity: ===
	Inequality: !=  or  <>
	Non-Identity:  !==
