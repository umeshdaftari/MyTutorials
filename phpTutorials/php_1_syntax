PHP CASE SENSITIVITY
In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive.

eg. Below example is legal:

			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>
			<body>

			<?php
				ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
				echo "Hello World!<br>";
				EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
			?>

			</body>
			</html>

However; all variable names are case-sensitive.
