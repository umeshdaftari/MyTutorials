STEPS

1. To turn the server on, go to the project directory and open terminal from within. 
2. Run: "python3 -m http.server" without quotes
3. If you create a server from a directory, and the file requires a file which is present in the parent directory,
   then it won't be accessible on the server. Instead, close the server and create the server through the parent directory
   by following step 1 and 2.
4 .To shut a server: "ctrl + c"
